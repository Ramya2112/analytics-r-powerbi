# analytics-r-powerbi
Using k-means clustering to group every singe car depending on the number of cylinders present.

## Objective
To use unsupervised machine learning model like k-means to find whether it is possible to derive clusters in the mtcars data set that would match the number of cylinders. 
K-means would seek to approximate each car into one of predetermined number of groups(aka clusters). 

## Technology 
R - packages used ggplot2, dplyr, cluster, gridExtra, tibble, factoextra

## Visualization
Power BI 

## Dataset
R inbuilt dataset mtcars.csv
